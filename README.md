# Classifying Breast Cancer Using Supervised Learning Techniques

In this report I aim to create 2 classifiers to predict the classification of breast cancer when given a number of properties regarding a tumour. Code produced for this task will be included separately to this report.

## Tasks Overview

Using the breast cancer dataset provided by Wisconsin University, complete the following tasks: 
1. Tell us something useful about the difficulty of classifying this data.
2. Build two classifiers and compare them.
3. What would you do if you come across a dataset that contains missing values.

## Classifiers

The classifiers in this report are: logistic regression and k-nearest neighbours models. In order to run them, simply execute the main methods in their corresponding files.
